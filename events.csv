Danhas been tutoring science for over fifteen years, specializing in physics, organic chemistry, and general chemistry, and he has a science degree from Yale University where he studied biochemistry and computer science. He worked as a teacher for a large test prep company for seven years training other instructors and teaching, in the process receiving the national teacher of the year award once and the Long Island teacher of the year award four times. After leaving this company the results of subsequent students have been even better. Given that only about twenty percent of students receive 512+ (on the current scale) scores nationally, the fact that over forty - five percent of his students have received 512+ has been the most important statistic in my opinion*. Furthermore, among the highest performing students academically (3. 8+ sGPA), over 90% (! ) of those students have received competitive scores to M. D. programs**. He's been teaching test prep in some form since taking the SAT about twenty - five years ago, although in recent years he's focused almost exclusively on MCAT, given how much he's enjoyed teaching thinking and problem solving skills in the sciences. He earned a perfect score on the SAT and a 39 (translates to about 524 on the current scale, 99th percentile) on the MCAT.",Pre-Med Society,Pre-Med Society,Credit,,1744074000,1744077000

Architecture and Urban Design Club: General Body Meeting,SAC 302,,https://stonybrook.campuslabs.com/engage/event/10853820,"Hosted by Architecture and Urban Design Club at SBU, general body meetings involve various different activities that challenge members to think critically about the architecture and spaces around them. Over the course of the semester, members will work in various groups rethinking some of the most underwhelming spots on campus. Each group will draw, write, and communicate creative design solutions that are specific to the selected site through intensive discussion and creative sessions. Members will create visuals that best represent their project and if time and effort provides, may feature detailed renderings. These projects typically span a couple of weeks during each meeting and are a great experience for those looking to develop their creative portfolios or gain experience in collaborative environments. The club also seeks to incorporate additional activities for members to get involved in that pertain to architecture and urban design.",Architecture and Urban Design Club,Architecture and Urban Design Club,Credit,,1745449200,1745452200
