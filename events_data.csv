Where and how does one experience wonder?Since Greek antiquity, wonder has been concerned with developments of knowledge and artistic production; associated with philosophical traditions of teaching, learning and writing; applied to objects and treasures; linked to response and affect; and depicted as curiosity, awe, uncertainty, astonishment, disgust and horror.

If wonder can be object and response within a larger network of knowledge production, how do objects of wonder fit into networks or webs of the wondrous? Virginia Woolf envisioned wonder as natural and material: ""Fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners."" These frameworks of wonder are both present in the tapestry; its vibrant intricacies are developed from a single thread into a complete scene, exemplifying the endless ways in which wonder is process, affect and object.

The Latin root of text comes from textus, meaning ""style, tissue of a literary work, lit. that which is woven, web, texture."" Again, this metaphor connects writing, thinking, and teaching to a object. Further traces of this idea can be found in disparate topics such as Indigenous spirituality, Greek mythology, and literary criticism. The spider's web, the World Wide Web, and theories of intertextuality help visualize the often-invisible systems of creation that produce wonder.

This conference includes projects that engage with conceptions of webs and wonder, including interdisciplinary studies of networks, matrices, and patterns across media, wonder as a cognitive or emotional response, and wonder as physical and tangible objects of connectivity.","DDepartment of English, Graduate English Society",DDepartment of English,Credit,No categories found,"Friday, February 28 2025 at 8:00 AMESTto","Friday, February 28 2025 at 5:00 PMEST"

Cycles of Clayexplores the profound creativity of Sunkoo Yuh, an artist who navigates the intersections of cultural heritage and contemporary expression. Yuh‚Äôs ceramic sculptures combine bold colors, evocative imagery, and intricate figures layered vertically to evoke histories and community connection. Themes of Buddhist cycles, Confucian ideals, and sociopolitical commentary permeate his works, which includes monumental pieces likeLong Beach SummerandAthens Winter. Through experimental glazing and unpredictable firing techniques, Yuh captures the tension between order and chaos to create visually compelling sculptures that explore life‚Äôs beauty, fragility, and complexity.
This exhibition is curated by Jinyoung A. Jin, the director of Asian art and culture at the Charles B. Wang Center.

Dr. OiYan Poon, a nationally recognized scholar on race and education, will discuss how answering her daughter‚Äôs questions about race inspired her book Asian American Is Not a Color: Conversations About Race, Affirmative Action, and Family. Recognizing that even young children seek to understand complex issues, Dr. Poon emphasizes the importance of nurturing curiosity about race, gender, and oppression.
Amidst nationwide debates and restrictive policies targeting educators and librarians, Dr. Poon reflects on the challenges of parenting and teaching in this current political climate. She advocates for fostering intergenerational conversations about how communities and leaders resist marginalization and advance social justice. Her talk underscores the critical role of education in cultivating knowledge and understanding in a diverse society.
Presented in partnership with the AAPI Heritages Committee.
Co-sponsored by the Department of Asian & Asian American Studies, University Libraries, and the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Intercultural Initiatives.
About the presenter
Dr. OiYan Poon, the co-director of the College Admissions Futures Co-Laborative, researches Asian American racial politics, education access, and affirmative action. Her bookAsian American Is Not a Color(2024) explores race relations and education policy through personal narratives and interviews. She is also the co-editor ofRethinking College Admissions(2022), which examines systemic inequities in admissions. An award-winning scholar, her work has been featured in theNew York Times, NPR, and other media publications. Born in Massachusetts to Hong Kong immigrants, Dr. Poon lives in Chicago with her family, and enjoys baking, reality TV, and lakefront strolls.","Charles B.

Over the course of the semester, members will work in various groups rethinking some of the most underwhelming spots on campus. Each group will draw, write, and communicate creative design solutions that are specific to the selected site through intensive discussion and creative sessions. Members will create visuals that best represent their project and if time and effort provides, may feature detailed renderings. These projects typically span a couple of weeks during each meeting and are a great experience for those looking to develop their creative portfolios or gain experience in collaborative environments.

Over the course of the semester, members will work in various groups rethinking some of the most underwhelming spots on campus. Each group will draw, write, and communicate creative design solutions that are specific to the selected site through intensive discussion and creative sessions. Members will create visuals that best represent their project and if time and effort provides, may feature detailed renderings. These projects typically span a couple of weeks during each meeting and are a great experience for those looking to develop their creative portfolios or gain experience in collaborative environments.
The club also seeks to incorporate additional activities for members to get involved in that pertain to architecture and urban design.",Architecture and Urban Design Club,Architecture and Urban Design Club,Credit,No categories found,"Wednesday, April 16 2025 at 6:00 PMEDTto","Wednesday, April 16 2025 at 6:50 PMEDT"

Over the course of the semester, members will work in various groups rethinking some of the most underwhelming spots on campus. Each group will draw, write, and communicate creative design solutions that are specific to the selected site through intensive discussion and creative sessions. Members will create visuals that best represent their project and if time and effort provides, may feature detailed renderings. These projects typically span a couple of weeks during each meeting and are a great experience for those looking to develop their creative portfolios or gain experience in collaborative environments.
