Cycles of Clayexplores the profound creativity of Sunkoo Yuh, an artist who navigates the intersections of cultural heritage and contemporary expression. Yuh‚Äôs ceramic sculptures combine bold colors, evocative imagery, and intricate figures layered vertically to evoke histories and community connection. Themes of Buddhist cycles, Confucian ideals, and sociopolitical commentary permeate his works, which includes monumental pieces likeLong Beach SummerandAthens Winter. Through experimental glazing and unpredictable firing techniques, Yuh captures the tension between order and chaos to create visually compelling sculptures that explore life‚Äôs beauty, fragility, and complexity.
This exhibition is curated by Jinyoung A. Jin, the director of Asian art and culture at the Charles B. Wang Center.
The Wang Center will host the opening reception for this exhibition with Club Red, an informal gathering for all faculty and staff from every department across Stony Brook University, including both East and West Campuses.
